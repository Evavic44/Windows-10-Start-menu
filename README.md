### **What I Learnt**
Working on this project was quite tedious especially picking out the icons and writing the markup for each of them, this made me research on simpler ways to implement other tasks which I learn a lot from. This is a simple list of some of those things.

- `Firefox has a differnt property for styling scrollbars.`
